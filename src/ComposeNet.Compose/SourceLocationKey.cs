/// Deterministic slot-table key derived from a <c>[CallerLineNumber]</c>
/// / <c>[CallerFilePath]</c> pair. Used by every group/lambda key the
/// facade hands to Compose so the same call site produces the same
/// <c>int</c> in every process — a hard requirement for
/// <see cref="Compose.RememberSaveable{T}(System.Func{T}, int, string)"/>,
/// whose <c>SaveableStateRegistry</c> key is built from the full chain
/// of ancestor group keys leading to the call.

/// <remarks>
/// <see cref="System.HashCode.Combine{T1,T2}(T1,T2)"/> and
/// <see cref="string.GetHashCode()"/> are randomized per process on
/// modern .NET, so they can't be used here — the saved key embedded
/// in <c>onSaveInstanceState</c> would never match the key recomputed
/// after the activity is recreated, and every <c>rememberSaveable</c>
/// slot would silently reinitialise on restore. This helper uses
/// FNV-1a 32-bit over the UTF-16 code units of the path, then mixes
/// in the line number, giving a stable identifier with the same
/// collision footprint as a regular hash.
